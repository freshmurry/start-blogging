          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Have you thought about why you want to start a WordPress blog? What made you want to enroll in this course and learn more about blogging?</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">There are many different reasons why you may want to start a WordPress blog. I started my blog purely as a hobby, and it all grew from there! There are others who start their blog as a way to make money right from the very beginning.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">There is no right or wrong answer for why you should start a WordPress blog, and many people start blogs for all kinds of reasons.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>Quick note: If you just want to start your blog right away, you can just head to <a style="background-color: #ffffff; color: #1155cc; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;" href="https://freshmurry.com/start-blogging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How To Start A WordPress Blog on Bluehost</a> and start your blog in less than 15 minutes!</em></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;">Below are reasons you may want to think about starting a blog.</span></p>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;">Reasons to Start a WordPress Blog</span></h2>
          <h3>1. To Have Fun</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Before I started blogging, I never gave it a single thought. Now that I’ve been blogging for almost 5 years, I couldn’t imagine not blogging.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I like reading posts on other blogs, finding new people to talk to, and especially writing. Blogging is a fun hobby and business to have, regardless of the subject that you are writing about.</p>

          <h3>2. To Blog For Others</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">No matter what type of blog you have, you are helping others. Someone may be motivated by your blog posts, they may learn something new, they may find enjoyment from reading your writing, and so on.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I like to talk about personal finance so that I can help others. For me, I have learned a lot (and I’m still learning) about blogging, extra income, personal finance and everything else – all from other bloggers.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Hopefully, my blog posts help and motivate others to be awesome with their finances as well. For example, I hope that all of my extra income posts help motivate others to create multiple streams of income. I hope that others will want to pay off their high-interest student loans. I hope that others want to become more in control when it comes to their finances.</p>

          <h3>3. To Be a Part of an Awesome Community</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I’ve made a lot of good friends through my blog. And, I love receiving emails from readers and blog friends that I’ve made. Being able to connect and learn from others is one of the biggest positives of blogging.</p>

          <h3>4. To Grow</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">A WordPress blog can help you grow in so many ways. You will most likely become even more passionate in the topics that you love, you will constantly learn new things, you will meet many new people, and more.</p>

          <h3>5. To Build a Business</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Of course, I have to include this as a reason to start a WordPress blog. Blogging can be a great way to improve the business you already have, or to create a business all on its own.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I know several successful bloggers and they all say the same thing, that blogging is the best thing that has ever happened to them. I agree!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;">I started as a hobby blogger and now I run a successful personal finance blog that earns over $300,000 a month, and I forecast it to continue to grow well into the future.</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;"> My blog allowed me and my husband to leave the day jobs we disliked to pursue something that we loved. Now, we travel full-time, make a great living, have a flexible schedule, have more time to spend with loved ones, </span><em>and</em><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;"> we will be able to retire early.</span></p>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">What To Blog About</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Determining what to blog about can seem difficult at first, but I promise it's not!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I always recommend creating a blog around a topic that you are passionate about, that you are an expert in, that you like, or something else along those lines.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">This can make blogging more fun instead of a chore.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">You can blog about several topics or you can blog about one specific thing such as personal finance. I even recently had someone email me about starting a blog about fabric art.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Yes, <strong>your blog can be about anything and/or everything</strong>. It’s entirely up to you.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">You can monetize any type of blog too, so do not let that fear hold you back. There are many, many ways to monetize blogs, even the most unique ones!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Here are some possible blog topic ideas. The list doesn’t end here either. Choose one, all, or some. It’s all up to you.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Lifestyle</li>
            <li>Home</li>
            <li>Family</li>
            <li>Parenting</li>
            <li>Finance</li>
            <li>Crafts</li>
            <li>DIY</li>
            <li>Small business</li>
            <li>Outdoors</li>
            <li>Fitness and health</li>
            <li>Food</li>
            <li>Inspiration and advice</li>
            <li>Animals</li>
            <li>Travel</li>
            <li>Games</li>
            <li>Music</li>
            <li>Relationships</li>
            <li>School</li>
            <li>Electronics and more!</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">That’s the beauty about having a blog. It can be anything you want it to be.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><strong><span style="font-size: 20px;">The blog planning tool you need.</span></strong></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I recommend getting the <strong>FREE Blog Structure Blueprint planning tool</strong>, which will help you start organizing your blog right away.<span class="yiv9848235414redactor-invisible-space"> With this free blog planning tool, you'll be able to brainstorm different topic and category ideas so that you can plan better for your blog.</span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="yiv9848235414redactor-invisible-space">After you download that, you may have some questions about what a subtopic is and what a category is. An example would be for my blog, subtopics would be Money, Travel, Blogging. Under the "Money" subtopic, my categories would be: Budget, Debt, Extra Income, etc. These are just all ideas for things that you can blog about.</span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span class="yiv9848235414redactor-invisible-space">Hope that makes sense. I definitely recommend downloading that planning tool and planning your blog right away :)</span></p>

          <h4><strong>Should a person be an expert or have a degree in the niche they choose?</strong></h4>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">A question I often receive is if a person should be an “expert” in their niche before they start a blog. I receive this question all the time and, due to that, I definitely think it’s something that needs to be discussed.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I don’t think you need to be an expert or have a degree in most cases when it comes to blogging.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I know many personal finance writers with blogs that track the financial mess they got themselves into. They don’t have financial degrees but are doing very well for themselves and help many people with their blogs. Many times readers just want to hear from you, follow a real person’s journey, read about how a real person made it through a problem, and so on. This is a great example of why degrees are not always needed.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">However, if you are wanting to give advice about legal or tax matters where you could get someone in a lot of trouble if you tell them the wrong information, then, yes, you should probably be an expert.</p>

          <h3>How do you come up with a blog name?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Make it easy.</strong> My blog name isn't the easiest for a person to spell, and even I sometimes jumble it when I'm spelling it to someone. So, my top tip would be to make sure that it is easy to type. I've seen blog names that are extremely long, contain words that are difficult to spell, and so on. Instead, you should make it as easy as possible for your reader.</li>
            <li><strong>Think about what you'll be writing about.</strong> You should think about the topics you want to write about on your website, who your target audience is, and more, and jot down descriptive words that are related to what you want your website to be about. Brainstorming this way can help you to think of a blog name!</li>
            <li><strong>Use a thesaurus to think of similar words.</strong> Sometimes, your first choice for a blog name may not be available, or perhaps you want to see if other words catch your attention better. A thesaurus can make this task easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Make it catchy. </strong>You may want to think of something funny, use alliteration, or something else to make your blog name catchy and memorable.</li>
            <li><strong>Use your name.</strong> If you don't want something catchy and/or if you think you're not creative enough, then just use your name. It's super easy that way, and more and more people are starting to do this.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I want you to think about what you will blog about. In the next section you will further learn how you can create your WordPress blog. I hope you're following along cause this is good stuff!</p>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">How to Make Money Blogging</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I'm sure this is a popular topic that many of you have been waiting for. There are several ways to make money blogging</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>If you are interested in starting a blog of your own, I created a tutorial that will help you <a style="color: #e55942;" title="How To Start a WordPress Blog on Bluehost" href="https://freshmurry.com/Bluehost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show to start a blog of your own for cheap</a>, starting at only $3.95 per month (this low price is only through my link) for blog hosting. In addition to the low pricing, you will receive a free website domain (a $15 value) through my <a style="color: #e55942;" title="Bluehost" href="https://freshmurry.com/Bluehost" target="_blank">Bluehost link</a> if you purchase, at least, 12 months of blog hosting. FYI, if you are asking yourself “can you make money blogging?” – my top tip is to be self-hosted. This is essential if you want to monetize your blog as you will appear more professional and this will help you monetize your blog tremendously. My blogging income did not take off until after I switched to self-hosted WordPress.</em></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Below are common questions about making money blogging.</p>

          <h3><strong><span class="yiv8733665664sumo_twilighter_highlighted yiv8733665664twilighter-5dceb343">Where does blog income come from?</span></strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">This is a question I have received many times lately. Many of you are interested in blogging, but you are not sure where the income actually comes from.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">You receive blogging income from <strong>whoever is paying you</strong>.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>If it is affiliate marketing you are providing, then you get paid through the company whenever someone buys or signs up for something through your link.</li>
            <li>If someone is paying you to place an advertisement on your website, then you get paid by them.</li>
            <li>If you have display ads on your website such as with Google Adsense, then you get paid from Google or one of the many other thousands of companies.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">There are many companies and blogging networks out there who are looking to pay for things on blogs!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">You usually get paid either through PayPal or by receiving a check in the mail.</p>

          <h3><strong>Can new bloggers make money blogging?</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">There is <strong>plenty of room for new bloggers to make money</strong>.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I’ve had many tell me that they started a blog because of my income reports and that they are able to make money blogging (awesome, right?!), this is proof that new bloggers are still making money. I also personally know bloggers who started a year or two after I did, yet they are making double, triple, or even 10 times the amount I am earning.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">The world is a huge place, and the online world is just going to keep growing. Every WordPress blogger earns a living online in a slightly different way, and everyone has a different message/story. Plus, there are TONS of different ways to make money through a blog, and I expect this to keep growing.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Due to the reasons above, I believe there will <i>always</i> be room for more bloggers.</p>

          <h3><strong>How long does it take to start making money blogging?</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">There is no one answer to this question.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I started earning a few hundred dollars a month from my blog less than one year after I started. After just two years of blogging, I was <strong>earning several thousands of dollars from blogging,</strong> which was all on the side of my day job.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I know some who started making thousands of dollars a month after just a few months of blogging. There are bloggers out there who began a year or two after me and are making hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. There are also other bloggers who aren’t making any money.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">As you can see, blogging is not a get rich quick scheme. However, if you are serious about it, you never know what it may turn into.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">It all depends on you, the effort you put into it, whether you have the time to learn how to monetize your blog, and more.</p>

          <h3><strong>What ways can a person start making money blogging?</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">There are several ways to make money blogging. These include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Affiliate marketing (this will be discussed in tomorrow's lesson)</li>
            <li>Blog sponsorships</li>
            <li>Display advertising</li>
            <li>Ebooks</li>
            <li>Staff Writing</li>
          </ul>
          <h3><strong>Can WordPress blogs get sponsored?</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Paid blog posts and advertisements are when you place an advertisement on your blog in exchange for money.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">This might be in the form of a sponsored review, a guest blog post, a sidebar link, an advertisement within a newsletter, and so on. There are many different forms of paid advertisements on websites.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">You can either reach out to advertisers yourself, sign up for advertising networks (some include Izea, Find Your Influence, or companies/advertisers may find you. There are many, many companies out there who are looking to advertise on blogs, so it is usually relatively easy to find blog sponsorships once you have a website.</p>

          <h3><strong>What is display advertising?</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Display advertising is when you place an advertisement on your blog in the sidebar, below a blog post, below your header image, or in some other location on your blog. Then, for every so many views that advertisement sees, you will earn a certain amount of money.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">It’s an easy way to make money blogging as all you have to do is insert the code provided to you. In general, the more page views you receive, the higher your income from ad networks will be.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">You can receive display advertisements for your blog from companies such as Media.net (this is a very popular one), Adsense, BlogHer, AdThrive, and many others.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><i>What is Adsense exactly?</i> Adsense is what many bloggers use, as it’s very easy and you can input Adsense advertisements on your blog starting from the very beginning. AdSense is an advertising network within Google that allows website owners to place advertisements on their websites. These ads are picked out by Google, and you just place the size and type of ad widget you want on your website. You are then paid per-click and per-impression.</p>

          <h3><strong>Is making money from an ebook realistic?</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">If you are an expert in an area or have something to share that you know others will read, then an ebook may be something you are interested in writing.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">There are quite a few people making thousands and tens of thousands of dollars each month from writing an ebook.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I recommend reading Learn How To Create A Profitable Ebook With Abby Lawson for more information. Abby made over $110,000 from sales of digital products (such as eBooks) in one year. She started just a few years ago knowing nothing about blogging and now makes six figures a year, due in large part to her eBooks. She is now teaching others the process she uses to write and launch profitable eBooks, and you guys, it is genius!</p>

          <h3><strong>Can a WordPress blogger make money writing for others?</strong></h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Lastly, your blog can also be used as a platform for other projects, such as for staff writing on other blogs.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">If you want to staff write for others, I highly recommend having a website of some sort so others can find your work and hire you. It’s much more difficult to get your name out there without your own website.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Staff writers usually start out around $25 per article, and as you gain more experience, you can usually command higher prices.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I know some writers who are making thousands of dollars a month from writing for others, and it all started because of their blog. In fact, I recently secured a staff writing gig for $1,500 per article, which equates to around $2.50 per word. I never would have received this offer if it wasn’t for my blog.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Next, you will learn how to make passive income from blogging!</p>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">How to Make Money Through Affiliate Marketing</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Affiliate income is my favorite way of earning a living online. And, yes, there are affiliate links within this website.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Just around two years ago, I was barely earning anything from affiliate income, but now I’m earning around <strong>$50,000 a month from it!</strong></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Affiliate income is when you place an affiliate link in a blog post and try to earn money from people buying the product through your link.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">This can be a good way to make money because if there is a product out there that you love, all you have to do is review the product and hopefully others will be interested in buying it as well.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Affiliate income is great because you can create a post, review, etc., and that post may earn you money years down the line with minimal work needed to maintain the article. It can be somewhat passive, which is what I love about it.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Yes, this means that you may be able to earn money while you are sleeping, on vacation, out dancing with friends, and more.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">What could be better than that?</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>If you are interested in starting a blog of your own, I created a tutorial that will help you <a style="color: #e55942; text-decoration: underline;" title="How To Start a WordPress Blog" href="https://freshmurry.com/start-blogging" target="_blank">start a blog of your own for cheap</a>, starting at only $2.75 per month (this low price is only through my link) for blog hosting. In addition to the low pricing, you will receive a free website domain (a $15 value) through my <a style="color: #e55942; text-decoration: underline;" title="Bluehost" href="https://freshmurry.com/Bluehost" target="_blank">Bluehost link</a> if you purchase, at least, 12 months of blog hosting. FYI, if you are asking yourself “can you make money blogging?” – my top tip is to be self-hosted. This is essential if you want to monetize your blog as you will appear more professional and this will help you monetize your blog tremendously. My blogging income did not take off until after I switched to self-hosted WordPress.</em></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Here are some of my tips for increasing your affiliate income:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><i>Use the Pretty Link plugin.</i> I use this for all of my affiliate links. It makes them look cleaner when it looks like "<a href="http://freshmurry.com/Bluehost" target="_blank">freshmurry.com/Bluehost</a>" instead of the long links that affiliate programs usually provide.</li>
            <li><i>Provide real reviews.</i> You should always be honest with your reviews. If there is something you don’t like about a product either don’t review the product at all or mention the negatives in your review.</li>
            <li><i>Ask for raises.</i> If you are doing well with a particular affiliate program, ask for a raise. The worst thing that can happen is that your affiliate manager says no. The best is that they say yes!</li>
            <li><i>Form a good relationship with your affiliate manager</i>. Your affiliate manager can supply your readers with valuable coupons, affiliate raises, and more.</li>
            <li><i>Publish tutorials</i>. Readers want to know how they can use a product. Showing them how to use it and how it can benefit them can be very helpful.</li>
            <li><i>Have a recommendations page</i>. I always like checking out recommendation pages on blogs. It can be a great way to list valuable products and services that readers may need or want.</li>
            <li><em>Join affiliate programs.</em> There are many different affiliate programs to check out. These include Max Bounty, Avant Link, Shareasale, Flex Offers, Commission Junction, Amazon’s Affiliate Program, and so on. If you enjoy a product, there is probably some sort of affiliate out there for it.</li>
            <li><i>Don’t go overboard.</i> There is no need to include an affiliate link 1,000 times in a blog post. Include them at the beginning, middle, and the end, and readers will notice it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I recommend checking out a online course for bloggers, <em><strong>Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing</strong></em>. <span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;">I regularly earn over $75,000 a month through affiliate marketing. This course provides the exact strategy and tips  that I use in my own blog. Quite simply, this online course is very informative. If you're a beginner blogger, then you NEED this course.</span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Next, you will learn how to build your traffic and attract readers. Follow along below, you don' want to miss this!</p>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">How to Build Your Traffic and Attract Readers</h2> <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">You do not need millions of page views per month to make money blogging, but it is something you will want to increase if you want to improve your income.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Every blog is different, but once you understand what your readers want, understand how to effectively reach out to companies for partnerships, and know how to charge the correct rate, you can make a good income online in many cases, regardless of the amount of page views you receive.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">There are many different ways to increase the number of page views you receive so you can make money blogging.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Here are my tips:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong><i>Publish high-quality blog posts</i></strong> – Your blog posts should always be high-quality and helpful. This will lead to readers coming back for more and more. I always recommend that a blog post be at least 500 words, but more wouldn’t hurt either. The majority of my blog posts are around 1,500 to 3,000 words.</li>
            <li><strong><i>Be active on Pinterest</i></strong> – Pinterest is one of my top traffic sources. I recommend creating great images, making sure the description and title of your images are catchy, pinning regularly, and only pinning long images. In case you are wondering, I use <a style="color: #88b564;" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Picmonkey</a> to edit all of my images and <a href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tailwind</a> to schedule them.</li>
            <li><strong><i>Find other social media sites to be active on as well</i></strong> – Besides Pinterest, there are several other social networking sites you may want to check out. This includes Facebook, Twitter, StumbleUpon, Periscope, Instagram, Snapchat, Youtube, and others.</li>
            <li><strong><i>Post regularly</i></strong> – For most blogs, you should publish something at least once a week if you want to make money blogging. Going for weeks or months at a time without a blog post can lead to readers forgetting about you.</li>
            <li><strong><i>Network with other bloggers</i></strong> – Too many bloggers see other bloggers as competition. However, you should see them as friends and colleagues. This means you may want to interact with them on social media, reach out to them via email, attend conferences, and more. Of course, be genuine with it all, and give more than you take.</li>
            <li><strong><i>Guest post</i></strong> – Guest posting can lead to new readers checking out your blog and subscribing to it. This can be a great way to reach a new audience.</li>
            <li><strong><i>Make sure it’s easy to share your content</i></strong> – I love sharing posts on social media, however it gets frustrating when some blogs make it more difficult than it needs to be. You should always make sure it’s easy for readers to share your content. This may mean making your social media icons easy to find, having all of the info input that is needed for sharing (title, link, and your username), and so on. Also, you should make sure that when someone clicks on one of your sharing icons the title isn’t in CAPS (I’ve seen this too many times). No one wants to share a blog post when it sounds like you’re screaming at them.</li>
            <li><strong><i>Create catchy headlines</i></strong> – The title of your post is a major factor influencing whether readers click over or not.</li>
            <li><strong><i>Learn SEO</i></strong> – SEO (search engine optimization) is not something I could teach in such a small section of post. I recommend doing your research and learning more about what it is and how it can help you.</li>
            <li><strong><i>Make it easy for readers to browse</i></strong> – If you want more pageviews, you should make it as easy as possible for readers to read other blog posts of yours. You will want to make it easy for readers to find your blog homepage, categories, tags, search bar, and so on. Also, I recommend including links in every single one of your blog posts, so readers can easily find related topics.</li>
          </ol>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Next, you will learn other miscellaneous blogging tips.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Miscellaneous Blogging Tips</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I want to share miscellaneous blogging tips that will help you be successful. Read below to learn more of my top blogging tips.</p>

          <h3>Be Yourself</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">When starting your blog, be yourself! Don’t try to pretend you’re someone else. I love reading real blogs where I can tell who the writer is just by reading what they have written. No one wants to read bland, boring posts. Inject all of your personality in them!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Have fun with it and determine why you really want to blog.</p>

          <h3>Have an About Page</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Something that I am currently working on is improving my About page. I personally mainly enjoy reading blogs that have a fun or interesting personal view. Corporate blogs and <em>blah blah blah</em> don’t really interest me as much (nothing wrong with them, everyone enjoys different things).</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I like to read about the author and see where he or she is coming from.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Having an About page lets me learn more about you, all in one easy page. You can include a picture, a bio about yourself, and possibly links to other posts that will describe you and your life even further.</p>

          <h3>Reply to Comments</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Something that I always put major effort towards is always making sure to reply to comments. Sometimes the comments are just a “thanks,” but I honestly enjoy knowing that an author has actually read the comment that I have left.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I LOVE when I leave a comment on a blog that contains a question, and the writer will answer it.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I almost always go back to blogs that I comment on to see what was written back. Interacting with readers is always important.</p>

          <h3>Get Rid of Captcha</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>Captcha, oh captcha</em>. I go nuts when I try leaving a comment and I see this. For some reason I can never get it on the first try. I’m fine with the “tests” right before you leave a comment that ask for what “1+1” is, but when it says to decipher what “32097 dfg fdgjh3 4” and it’s super blurry and all of the letters seem to go in different directions?</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Sometimes I feel like I’m trying forever and have given up on leaving a comment before.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Instead install a good comment spam plugin that doesn't make your readers jump through hoops.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I like the free WordPress plugin "Akismet."</p>

          <h3>Build a Loyal Following</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">With my online course, <span style="color: #88b564;"><a style="line-height: 1.6em;" href="https://freshmurry.com/start-blogging" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing</a>, </span><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;">you can learn exactly how to increase your traffic, build a loyal following, and more, all while making money blogging.</span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;">I earn over $50,000 a month through affiliate marketing and I share my exact strategy and tips in this very informative online course. If you're a blogger, then you NEED this course.</span></p>

          <h3>Make it Easy to Subscribe</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">I cannot tell you how many times I have gone to a website and they have made it impossible for me to subscribe. Either none of the links work, or there are no links altogether. No links for e-mail, Twitter, Facebook, subscribing, etc?</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Please make it easier for readers to subscribe! We want to be able to find you more easily in the future.</p>

          <h3>Make Friends</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;">One of the best things that I love about blogging is the awesome community that it brings. I have made many friends through my blog, and a lot of you I talk to nearly every single day. I really cannot say enough about making blogger friends. </span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;">Reach out by commenting on their blogs, interacting on Facebook, tweeting on Twitter and so on. Of course, be yourself, and don’t force a relationship to happen. </span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;">Be natural and make friends just like how you would in "real life."</span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;"> </span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><span style="font-family: inherit; color: #000000; font-size: 21px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.3; background-color: initial;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">Link Your Twitter Account to Your Posts</span></span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">A lot of the time I like to tweet posts that I really enjoy. I’ve been to a couple of blogs where when you click on the tweet button, the person’s Twitter handle does not automatically show up. Fix this! Make it easier for people to show you recognition. This is something that I didn’t do for a long time, until a couple of other bloggers told me that I was making life too difficult for them (joking of course).</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">P.S. A good sharing plugin for your blog is "Shareaholic." It's what I use and it's free!</p>

          <h3>Have Fun!</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Yes, different people start a blog for different reasons. But if you do decide to start one, have fun with it! I feel that the best blogs out there are by writers who are having fun with it. I enjoy having a blog, and it has turned into a great hobby and business.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><em>If you are interested in starting a blog of your own, I created a tutorial that will help you <a style="color: #e55942; text-decoration: underline;" title="How To Start a WordPress Blog" href="https://freshmurry.com/start-blogging" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">start a blog of your own for cheap</a>, starting at only $3.95 per month (this low price is only through my link) for blog hosting.

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
          I hope you learned a lot over the past few parts and have a good idea of the kind of blog you want to create.</p>
         <p> I'll be back to check on things and to continue to add great content.</p>
