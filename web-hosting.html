        <p>Are you curious about web hosting or looking to start a blog and don't know exactly where to start?</p>

        <p>Each year it seems that more and more people are fascinated with the idea of starting a blog. This was me in October of 2018. I'd just about read everything I possibly could to make my decision.</p>

        <p>I found a great tutorial on YouTube and the rest is history. I've always been curious as to how to start a real blog but didn't think it was worthwhile.</p>

        <p>After reading various blogs, soon or later I read something that really peeked my interest. Bloggers were making tons of money working from the comfort of their homes.</p>

        <p>As if that wasn't enough convincing, I jumped right into blogging and never looked back. I'll teach you how to do exactly what I did.</p>

        <img class="center" src="https://freshmurry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/web-hosting-200x300.png" alt="web hosting" width="200" height="300" />

        <p>I wish there were comprehensive reading and training materials when I started. Nevertheless, keep following along with my short tutorial below to see exactly how to get started super fast.</p>

        <h2>What is web hosting?</h2>
        <p>According to <a href="https://share.website.com/freshmurry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website.com</a>, "Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website or web page onto the Internet. A web host or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed in the Internet."</p>

        <p>First, I’m going to show you how to register a domain name through Bluehost. Secondly, I'll show you how to purchase a great web hosting package to get you started. Quite simply, without web hosting your website will not be live online. Everyone has a hobby, business idea, or skill. <a href="https://freshmurry.com/start-blogging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create a blog on WordPress</a> to engage a like-minded community of people. Talk about tips and tricks that you’ve learned over the years. If you are a “shopaholic,” your more than likely to write about your favorite stores and how to find the best deals. Oh, and did I forget to mention, get paid for writing about shopping.</p>

        <p>Yes, it is as simple as that. Of course, it will take a great deal of up front work to reach that ultimate milestone of generating money from your blog. Nevertheless, at least you will be well on your way after you overcome your worst enemy and the greatest obstacle, and that is—starting.</p>

        <p>Let’s jump right into starting your blog.</p>

        <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/freshmurry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click "Get Started Now."</a> <p>Next, follow along with my simple step-by-step guide below.</p>
       
        &nbsp;
        <img class="aligncenter" src="img/Bluehost WordPress Blog.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Bluehost WordPress Blog"/>
        <h2><strong style="font-size: 23px;">1. Pick and Register your Domain Name</strong></h2>
        <a href="https://bluehost.com/track/freshmurry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><p>Click here to purchase a domain name to start your blog</a>. Next, continue to follow a few simple steps below.</p>

        <p>We all have an innate special hobby or topic that we can talk about forever. Your domain name can be a variation of this special hobby or topic. If available, Bluehost will tell you whether the name is available or not.</p>

        <p>Try writing a few domain name variations down on a piece of paper. Then, narrow down the names of your top three. From there, check to see if your domain names are available and one that you'd be happy with.</p>

        <p>Keep your domain name short, sweet, and memorable. Nevertheless, you'll most certainly have a great domain name that will resonate well with your audience.</p>

        <p>If you decide to<a href="https://bluehost.com/track/freshmurry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> use my link</a>, you’ll activate your  FREE domain and will have it for the length of your web hosting package. Purchasing 36 months of web hosting is <strong>more affordable and the best value plan for your money</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Cost Savings</h3>
        <p>I saved a ton of money going with the 36 months of web hosting. Similarly, you will benefit with cost savings when you purchase the 36 months of web hosting!</p>

        <p>The free domain is basically the "icing on top of the cake." Nevertheless, if you so choose a 12 or 24-month Basic web hosting package, you’ll stall be able to take advantage of receiving a free domain name.</p>

        <p>The choice is completely up to you. The 36-month plan just comes at a better value. Honestly, web hosting was probably the best money that I'd ever spent.</p>

        <p>If you decide on either package, continue to the step below. Next, I'll show you the various web hosting packages, how to purchase, and receive your free domain name.</p>

        <a href="http://bluehost.com/track/freshmurry"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-254 size-shareaholic-thumbnail" src="https://freshmurry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bluehost_1-640x649.png" alt="Bluehost Web Hosting Packages" width="640" height="649" /></a>

        <p>Web hosting plans are setup with the website owner in mind. Thus, if you purchase web hosting, it will further motivate you to finally put your site together just as you've always wanted.</p>

        <p>Also, you'll have complete control of how you run your site. Many bloggers go on to make a great side income from their blog.</p>

        <p>The "Basic" package may make better sense for those who are new to blogging!</p>

        <img class="aligncenter size-shareaholic-thumbnail wp-image-255" src="https://freshmurry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bluehost_2-640x438.png" alt="Bluehost Domain Registration" width="640" height="438" />

        <h2><strong style="font-size: 23px;">2. Purchase a Web Hosting Package</strong></h2>
        <h2><img class="aligncenter wp-image-257 size-large" src="https://freshmurry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Bluehost_Hosting-Packages-1024x699.png" alt="Bluehost Web Hosting Packages" width="750" height="512" /></h2>
        <p>It's super simple setting up a WordPress blog through Bluehost. Let's talk about the costs of creating a website:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All you need is to choose the "Basic" plan to get you started. It's only <a href="https://bluehost.com/track/freshmurry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$3.95 per month through my link</a>. The payment is due upfront, and the price is simply unbeatable. Fortunately, there are a few options such as the 24-month and the 60-month plan, both of which are still $3.95. There is a 12-month plan for $5.95 per month, while it maybe a few dollars higher, it still gives first time bloggers a year to test things out. Plus, you still get to choose your free domain name when you sign up for the 12-month package. Although, the 36-month package is still the better value. As mentioned before, the monthly rate is much better over that length of time.</li>
          <li>The Basic plan is all that you will need to start out. Just bypass the Plus and Business Pro plans. Those plans are more expensive, tailored for individuals who have a good handle on things, and those who manage multiple websites. There no need to buy extra services that you don't need right now.</li>
          <li>One other item that you may want to pay for is the Privacy Protection. Privacy Protection is $.99 per month. This add-on helps keep your contact information private and safe.</li>
          <li>Other than what is mentioned, you do not need to purchase any of the items that Bluehost sells. Just uncheck the unnecessary items.</li>
          <li>Remember when you <a href="https://bluehost.com/track/freshmurry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up using my link</a> you will receive a free domain name on any of the web hosting plans.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's take a deeper dive in your web hosting plan. First, most web hosting providers require users to pay monthly. However, paying monthly is not as effective as is would be to pay for a straight 12 or 36 months.</p>

        <p>Secondly, users who are on a month-to-month web hosting plan eventually lose causing the web hosting provider to profit more.</p>

        <p>For example, if your web hosting lapse without payment, your site will go down. Thirdly, when your site is down, you risk losing visitors, business, sponsorship, etc. Losing business or visitors is the kiss of death as a blogger.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, a month-to-month is just an outright expensive option. Paying a lump sum payment for a year or more of web hosting services is a way better option.</p>

        <p>Gladly, I've chosen the 36-month plan because I know that I'll save a ton over that length of time.</p>
        <h5>Setting up web hosting was easy, right?</h5>
